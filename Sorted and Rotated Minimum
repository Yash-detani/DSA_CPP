//Problem
A sorted array of distinct elements arr[] is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it. 

//Code

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, arr):
        #complete the function here
        n = len(arr)
        low = 0
        high = n-1
        
        while(low < high):
            
            if arr[low] < arr[high]:
                return arr[low]
                
            mid = (low + high) // 2
                
            if arr[mid] <= arr[high]:
                high = mid
                
            else:
                low = mid + 1
                
        return arr[low]
